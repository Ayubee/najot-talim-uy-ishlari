      <h2>About Florida</h2>
      <p>
        Florida (/ˈflɒrɪdə/ ⓘ FLORR-ih-də, Spanish: [floˈɾiða]) is a state in
        the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders the Gulf of
        Mexico to the west, Alabama to the northwest, Georgia to the north, the
        Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Straits of Florida and Cuba to the
        south. About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the Gulf
        of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. It has the longest coastline in the
        contiguous United States, spanning approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 km),
        not including its many barrier islands. It is the only state that
        borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. With a
        population of over 21 million, it is the third-most populous state in
        the United States and ranks eighth in population density as of 2020.
        Florida spans 65,758 square miles (170,310 km2), ranking 22nd in area
        among the states. The Miami metropolitan area, anchored by the cities of
        Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, is the state's largest
        metropolitan area, with a population of 6.138 million; the most populous
        city is Jacksonville. Florida's other major population centers include
        Tampa Bay, Orlando, Cape Coral, and the state capital of Tallahassee.
