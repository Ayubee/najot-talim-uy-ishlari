      <h2>About Delaver</h2>
      <p>
        Delaware (/ˈdɛləwɛər/ ⓘ DEL-ə-wair)[11] is a state in the Mid-Atlantic
        and South Atlantic states[12] region of the United States.[13] It
        borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New
        Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state's
        name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named
        after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the
        Colony of Virginia's first colonial-era governor.[14]
