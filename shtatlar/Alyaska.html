      <p>
        Alaska (/əˈlæskə/ ⓘ ə-LASS-kə) is a non-contiguous U.S. state on the
        northwest extremity of North America. It is in the Western United States
        region. The only other non-contiguous U.S. state is Hawaii. Alaska is
        also considered to be the northernmost, westernmost, and easternmost
        (the Aleutian Islands cross the 180th meridian into the eastern
        hemisphere) state in the United States. It borders the Canadian
        territory of Yukon and the province of British Columbia to the east. It
        shares a western maritime border, in the Bering Strait, with Russia's
        Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic
        Ocean lie to the north, and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south.
        Technically, it is a semi-exclave of the U.S., and is the largest
        exclave in the world.
