      <h2>About Alabama</h2>
      <p>
        Alabama is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It
        borders Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the
        Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the
        30th largest by area[10] and the 24th-most populous of the 50 U.S.
        states.[11] Alabama is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state
        bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton
        State". The state has diverse geography, with the north dominated by the
        mountainous Tennessee Valley and the south by Mobile Bay, a historically
        significant port. Alabama's capital is Montgomery, and its largest city
        by population and area is Huntsville.[12] Its oldest city is Mobile,
        founded by French colonists (Alabama Creoles) in 1702 as the capital of
        French Louisiana.[13][14] Greater Birmingham is Alabama's largest
        metropolitan area and its economic center.[15] Politically, as part of
        the Deep South, or "Bible Belt", Alabama is a predominantly conservative
        state, and is known for its Southern culture. Within Alabama, American
        football, particularly at the college level, plays a major part of the
        state's culture.
