      <p>
        Connecticut (/kəˈnɛtɪkət/ ⓘ kə-NET-ik-ət)[10] is the southernmost state
        in the New England region of the Eastern United States. It lies on Long
        Island Sound, which enters the Atlantic Ocean. It borders Rhode Island
        to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long
        Island Sound to the south. Its capital is Hartford, and its most
        populous city is Bridgeport. Connecticut lies between the major hubs of
        New York City and Boston along the Northeast Corridor. The New York
        metropolitan area, which includes six of Connecticut's seven largest
        cities, extends well into the southwestern part of the state, while the
        northeastern corner reaches Greater Boston.[11] Connecticut is the
        third-smallest state by area after Rhode Island and Delaware, and the
        29th most populous with slightly more than 3.6 million residents as of
        2020,[12] ranking it fourth among the most densely populated U.S.
        states.
