      <h2>About Arkanzas</h2>
      <p>
        Arkansas (/ˈɑːrkənsɔː/ ⓘ AR-kən-saw[c]) is a landlocked state in the
        West South Central region of the Southern United States.[9][10] It
        borders Missouri to the north, Tennessee and Mississippi to the east,
        Louisiana to the south, Texas to the southwest, and Oklahoma to the
        west. Its name derives from the Osage language, and refers to their
        relatives, the Quapaw people.[11] The state's diverse geography ranges
        from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains, which
        make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the
        south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along
        the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.
