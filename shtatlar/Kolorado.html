      <p>
        Colorado (/ˌkɒləˈrædoʊ, -ˈrɑːdoʊ/ ⓘ KOL-ə-RAD-oh, -⁠RAH-doh,[8][9] other
        variants;[10] Spanish: [koloˈɾaðo]) is a state in the Western United
        States. It is one of the Mountain states, sharing the Four Corners
        region with Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. It is also bordered by
        Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the northeast, Kansas to the east, and
        Oklahoma to the southeast. Colorado is noted for its landscape of
        mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons, plateaus, rivers, and
        desert lands. It encompasses most of the Southern Rocky Mountains, as
        well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western
        edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is the eighth most extensive and 21st
        most populous U.S. state. The United States Census Bureau estimated the
        population of Colorado at 5,877,610 as of July 1, 2023, a 1.80% increase
        since the 2020 United States census.[11]
